h2 Kill Chain

x) Summary

The intrusion kill chain is inspired the military. It lists a step by step guide on how to lead a successful cyberattack. If one step fails, the attack fails. There are 7 steps:
Reconnaissance – study of the target
Weaponization – building of the tool. Malware in PDF or word document
Delivery – sending the tool
Exploitation – the tool is triggered 
Installation – installing backdoor
Command and control – infected pc connects to the attacker’s network
Action and objectives – the attacker can do what he came in for
This seems to be a linear process and I’m certain that in a real environment, it is way more complicated than that and there is probably a lot of back and forth between steps. 

a) Tactics, tools and procedures

Tactics are the “why” or the reason an attacker performs an attack.
•	Ex: stealing sensitive data
Techniques are the “how” or the way to achieve the set goal.	
•	Ex: phishing email
Subtechniques are a variation of the technique.
•	Ex: spearphishing attachments
Procedures are the actual tool used by the attacker.
•	Ex: ransomware 
The Mitre att&ck system seems better adapted to modern times as it provides a extensive list of tactics, techniques and procedures to help mitigate, detect and fight off attackers. It also works for mobile phones.
