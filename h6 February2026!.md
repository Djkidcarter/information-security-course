Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions

One way functions are an important part of public key cryptography. They are easy to compute but very difficult to reverse.
The author gives the analogy of the plate as a good example of a one way function. It is easy to break a plate into lots of small pieces
but it is very hard to put those pieces back together to reconstruct the plate.
Mathematicians did not proved that one way functions exist. We just use functions that are so difficult to crack that they might as well be one way.
One way functions cannot be used for encryption as is. No one could decrypt it. We need something else, a trapdoor one way function.
It contains the secret instruction on how to reverse the process. The author gives this time a watch analogy. It is easy to take all the components of a watch apart.
It is incredibly difficult to put back together but if you have access to the instruction, the task becomes a lot easier.
